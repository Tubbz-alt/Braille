# Braille
A plugin for Rhino Grasshopper to process Braille


This plugin was started as a way to have a simple method of generating Braille type and placing it with in a fabrication enviroment, 
where it was then used to prototype how different patterns, visual and tactile, could interact constructivly.

The plugin translates text using grade one Braille to a sorted tree of points that then can be used further in fabrication.

It supports custom settings for spacing as well as 6 and 8 point Braille.

This plugin was used in the followiung paper: [Robotic Braille and Spatial Maps - Combining tactile and visual Narratives](https://issuu.com/artun/docs/space_and_digital_reality_web)
